<h2>Description</h2>
This game was created for the HackYeah, stationary hackathon in Krakow. It was my first time doing a gamejam. The theme of the jam was Dinosaurs, which inspired me to create a short game where you play like a one of them, trying to survive apocalypse. By destroying the meteors with your cursor, you get currency to purchase upgrades. Main goal is to buy the most expensive upgrade - Napoleon's hat. This will show a short ending animation with dino sitting in the way similar to the popular Napoleon's posture on the Saint Helena island.

<h2> General thoughts: </h2>



 <h3> ${\textsf{\color{GREEN}What I'm proud of:}}$ </h3>

游릭 First gamejam game.   
游릭 Simple but smooth animations.  
游릭 Cool idea for a short game, mixed with throughfull story.  
游릭 Sprites not so good but all are in the same design.  
游릭 Made music by my own!(except ending...).  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{RED}What I'm not satisfied with:}}$ </h3>
 
游댮 Hitboxes.  
游댮 Not optimized in filed of creating object -> instead Instatntiate + Destroy I could create set of GameObjects from start.  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{BLUE}What I learned:}}$  </h3>

游댯 Working with UI.  
游댯 Making cutscenes.  
游댯 There's still a lot of work and improvement ahead of me.  
游댯 The importance of using interfaces in programming.
